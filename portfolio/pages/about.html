<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Anjan, a ServiceNow wizard, data science geek, and professional problem solver. I automate workflows like a magician, analyze data like a detective, and occasionally break production (but only to make it better). I thrive on challenges, love learning new tech, and firmly believe that every bug is just a misunderstood feature waiting to be optimized. When I’m not coding, I’m probably at the gym lifting weights or debugging my meal plan.</p>
